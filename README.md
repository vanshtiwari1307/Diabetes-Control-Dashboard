# Diabetes Nutrition & Glycemic Control Dashboard in Power BI. ðŸ©ºðŸ“Š
Iâ€™ve developed a Diabetes Nutrition & Glycemic Control Dashboard using Power BI, aimed at helping individuals â€“ especially those managing diabetes â€“ make informed dietary choices.<br>
<br>
This interactive dashboard provides:<br>
<br>
 âœ… Daily calorie tracking for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner<br>
 âœ… Insights into carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber intake<br>
 âœ… Glycemic index monitoring by meal and group<br>
 âœ… Comparison between diabetic & non-diabetic lifestyle patterns<br>
 âœ… Easy-to-use visuals with filters for personalized analysis<br>
<br>
<br>
ðŸ’¡ How it helps:<br>
Patients â†’ Make smarter dietary choices to manage blood sugar<br>
Doctors/Nutritionists â†’ Design personalized diet plans<br>
Researchers/Startups â†’ Study lifestyle & nutrition impacts on diabetes<br>
<br>
This project highlights how Power BI can transform nutrition data into actionable health insights for better decision-making.<br>
<br>
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback or suggestions!<br>
